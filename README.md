## Hi there, I'm Zach Laocmbe ðŸ‘‹

I'm building up a personal lab environment to learn infrastructure, self-hosting, and automation. This is where I keep track of my progress, share what I'm learning, and publish useful configurations.\

### ðŸ”§ Projects I'm Working On

- **Proxmox Cluster Setup**  
  My homelab foundation â€” eventually hosting services like Git, CI/CD, and personal tools.

- **VS Code Integration + Remote Dev**  
  Tracking how I connect VS Code to my Proxmox environment to develop remotely and efficiently.

- **Learning CI/CD with GitHub Actions**  
  Starting with GitHub to understand automation before moving to self-hosted tools like Jenkins.
